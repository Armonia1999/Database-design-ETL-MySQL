# Database-design-ETL-MySQL

In this project I used python to: scrape some data using Selenium, using Faker to generate the rest of the data, connect to our MySQL and design a database then populate with the data we obtained. Afterwards, we moved to MySQL to explore our data and answer some questions. Lastly, we took our data to Tableau and designed a dashboard that can be found in this link : https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/armonia8525/viz/WanhuiSociety/WanhuiDashboard
